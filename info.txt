SETTING UP DJANGO

1. pipenv install django
    this creates a new venv and installs django in it.
    this also creates Pipfile and Pipfile.lock
    venv STILL needs to be activated...
    we want to use the python interpreter in the venv we created, not the global environment.

2 pipenv shell
    activates venv, launches subshell

(
    django-admin 
        gives list of django-admin commands
)

3. (
        django-admin startproject YOUR_PROJECT_NAME (creates new django project directory in current directory)
        OR
        django startproject YOUR_PROJECT_NAME . (creates django project, treats current directory as core project directory)
    )

(
    manage.py is a wrapper around django-admin. at this point use manage.py as a command instead, because it takes into account the settings of this project
)

4. python manage.py runserver (PORT?) 
    at this point the server will run, showing the boiler-plate django response


5. pipenv --venv to get the path to our venv
    THEN open vscode command palate and select python select interpreter, copy paste it with /bin/python the path to the venv

(
    what i believe this does is configure vs code with the venv. after this step, if you kill the terminal and open a new one in the directory, it automatically activates the venv.

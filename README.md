# OBLIGATORY EXPLANATION
My favorite implication of the recent strides in AI technology is that as it develops, it will become less certain that anything you read was actually writted by a living, breathing human.\
On principle, I wanted to hate this. To me, the written word is sacred, and the idea that any AI-generated bullshit could be out there masquerading as a real person's thoughts or feelings seems offensive to reality. Because being able to write something convincingly human has, until recently, always been something ONLY humans can do. However, the more I pondered it, the more I see the necessity.\
My reaction to this technology is to be threatened because, to me, this type of AI presents an existential threat to the livelihood of A LOT of humans in the coming years. Why would companies pay customer service representatives when an AI is capable of talking to customers? Why would a company have so many junior web developers when an AI is capable of churning out React Components? Why would a media company pay journalists to write stories when an AI can do the same thing faster Amazon and McDonalds are already using robots to perform whole operations, do you think they're not throwing money at research to eventually replace people doing more subjective work?\
Unfortunately, we must accept that this is the future and it is futile to fight progress.
## BLURRING THE LINE
I decided to make reddit bots, and to utilize ChatGPT to make them convincingly human.\
!THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!\
!FOR REAL THIS SHIT PROLLY DONT EVEN CONTAIN CODE THAT WORKS AS A WHOLE YET!
Reggie is a know it all and his bread and butter will be r/explainlikeimfive\
Bette is a poet / writer and she will be responding to writing / poetry prompts.\
I don't know what Wilson Alvarez-Diez is gonna do yet but I think he's a gym douche and will engage on fitness subreddits.\
I plan on using a mix of scripting logic, and model priming, and some good-old-fashioned subjectivity to make these bots seem like real people.\
As always, tern up
